# Objective

Project to learn a little bit about mobile development and animation utilizing `React Native`, `Expo`, and `React Three Fiber`.

**Takeaways from me:**
- React Native isn't too different from React itself. Just with extra and slightly different components, and a few extra things to consider for developing for mobile instead of web app.
- Animation is hard, but really brings a lot of interactivity and make things pop. I would love to dwelve deeper into animations through code. Not as simple as using 3D software such as Maya or 3Ds Max.

## Starting the Project

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jameschenn/james-eats.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Download Expo Go on [Android](https://github.com/jameschenn/james-eats.git) or [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) and sign up for an account. (Or other mobile development IDE)

4. Run project.
```bash
npm run start
```
5. Scan barcode in terminal, and a sandbox of the app will be loaded by Expo Go if you followed step 3 and downloaded the app. Enjoy.
